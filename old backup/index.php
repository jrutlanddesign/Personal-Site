      <div class="twoColContent">
        <p>My love of all things design started at an early age, always having that creative edge. This love and passion flourished further when I discovered how to create things with code and my inner geek truly developed.</p>
        <p>Through my years as a UI designer I have had the privilege to have worked with some incredibly talented people - In-house design teams &amp; creative agencies big &amp; small.</p>
        <p>In 2016, I finally made the decision to go it alone and put all the knowledge I’ve learned over the years into becoming a freelance UI designer - and, great news - I have availability for your upcoming UI design project so <a href="#contactMe">let's talk</a>.</p>
        <p>When I'm not sat behind my Mac I'm just your regular family kinda guy, who loves sport and something good to eat.</p>

	          <h3>UI Design</h3>
	          <p>I design visually appealing user interfaces, not just to look good but to guide your user smoothly through every interaction of you website or app.</p>
	          <p>The user is at the forefront of each step of the process and the visual aspects of the UI are just an extension of the overall experience for the user.</p>
	          <p>Every button, every input is there due to planning in the UX stage.</p>

	        <h3>UX Design &amp; Research</h3>
	          <p>A stunning UI design isn't good enough on its own, it may be the soul of your website but the real heart is in how your users interact with your service or product.</p>
	          <p>During the initial UX phase I aim to establish the most intuitive experience that helps to guide your users to accomplish the tasks they need to achieve. I do this through a
						series of sitemapping, information architecture and wireframing.</p>

	          <h3>Front End Development</h3>
	          <p>With a solid understanding of the latest development, I can code the UI into HTML/CSS with functionality coming through javascript and jQuery.</p>
	          <p>Having this understanding also means I can pass on all assets onto your own development team when needed.</p>
