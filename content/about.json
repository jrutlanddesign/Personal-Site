        "So as you know, and more than likely the reason you're here, I'm a user interface (UI) designer, but you want to know more about what makes me tick.",
        "I'm going to kill your enthusisam right now, I'm not a digital nomad that travels from exotic location to exotic location, Macbook in hand telling of the time I saved a child from the jaws of a shark and still hit a tight deadline the same day. I'm just a pretty ordinary guy.",
