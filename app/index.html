        <h3>UI Design</h3>
        <p>I design visually appealing user interfaces, not just to look good but to guide your user a through every interaction of you website or app.</p>
        <p>The user is at the forefront of each step of the process and the visual aspects of the UI are just an extension of the overall experience for the user.</p>
        <p>Every button, every input is there due to planning in the UX stage.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="service">
          <h3>UX Design &amp; Research</h3>
          <p>A stunning UI design isn't good enough on its own, it may be the soul of your website but the real heart is in how your users interact with your service or product.</p>
          <p>During the initial UX phase I aim to establish the most intuitive experience that helps to guide your users to accomplish the tasks they need to achieve. I do this through a series of sitemapping, information architecture and wireframing.</p>
